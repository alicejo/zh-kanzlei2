<h2>II.	General information on data processing</h2>
<h3>1.	Scope of the processing of personal data</h3>
In general, we only process the personal data of our users to the extent that this is necessary for the provision of a functioning website and of our content and services. The processing of the personal data of our users is, as a rule, only conducted with the consent of the user. An exception applies in such cases when prior attainment of consent is not possible for specific reasons, and when the processing of the data is permitted by the statutory regulations.

<h3>2.	Legal basis for the processing of personal data</h3>
In cases where we obtain consent by the data subject for the purpose of processing personal data, Art. 6, Section 1, point a of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.<br>
When processing personal data required for the fulfilment of a contract, the contractual party of which is the data subject, Art. 6, Section 1, point b of the GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing procedures required for implementing pre-contractual measures.<br>
Should the processing of personal data be required for the fulfilment of a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6, Section 1, point c of the GDPR serves as the legal basis.<br>
If processing is required in order to uphold a justified interest of our company or of a third party, and if the interests, basic rights and basic freedoms of the data subject do not override this interest, Art. 6, Section 1, point f of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.

<h3>3.	Data erasure and duration of storage</h3>
The personal data of the data subject shall be erased or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage no longer applies. Data may furthermore be stored when this is provided by the European or national legislator in statutory Union regulations, laws or other specifications to which the controller is subject. A blockage or erasure of the data only occurs when a storage period specified by the above norms expires, unless there is a requirement for the continued storage of the data for a conclusion of contract or a fulfilment of contract.

<h2>III.	Provision of the website and creation of log files</h2>
<h3>1.	Description and scope of data processing</h3>
Each time our website is retrieved, our system automatically records data and information from the system of the retrieving computer.<br>
Here, the following data is collected: <br>
(1)	Information about the browser type and the version used<br>
(2)	The operating system of the user<br>
(3)	The Internet service provider of the user<br>
(4)	The date and time of access<br>
(5)	Websites from which the system of the user accesses our website <br>
(6)	Websites that are retrieved by the system of the user via our website<br>
The data is also stored in the log files of our system. The IP addresses of the user or other data that enable an association of the data with a user are not affected. Such data, as well as other personal data of the user, is not stored.

<h3>2.	Legal basis for data processing </h3>
The legal basis for the temporary storage of data is Art. 6 Section 1, point f of the GDPR. 
<h3>3.	Purpose of data processing</h3>
The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary in order to enable delivery of the website to the computer of the user. For this purpose, the IP address of the user must remain stored for the duration of the session.

<h3>4.	Duration of storage</h3>
The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the achievement of the purpose of its collection. In the case of recording of the data for the provision of the website, this is the case when the respective session is terminated.

<h3>5.	Opportunity for objection and removal</h3>
The recording of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in log files is of absolute necessity for the operation of the website. As a result, there is no opportunity on the part of the user to object.

<h2>IV.	Use of cookies</h2>
<h3>1.	Description and scope of data processing</h3>
Our website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in the Internet browser or by the Internet browser on the computer system of the user. When a user retrieves a website, a cookie can be stored in the operating system of the user. This cookie contains a characteristic sequence of characters which enables an unequivocal identification of the browser when the website is again retrieved.<br>
We use cookies to make our website more user-friendly. Some elements of our website make it necessary for the retrieving browser to also be identifiable after a move to another page.<br>
During this process, language settings are stored and transferred in the cookies. 
<h3>2.	Legal basis for the data processing </h3>
The legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is Art. 6, Section 1, point f of the GDPR.
<h3>3.	Purpose of data processing</h3>
The purpose of using cookies required for technical reasons is to simplify the use of websites by users. Some functions of our website may not be available without the use of cookies. For such functions, it is necessary for the browser to be recognised even after a move to another page. <br>
We require cookies in order to adopt language settings.<br>
The user data collected by cookies required for technical reasons is not used to create user profiles.<br>
These purposes constitute our justified interest in processing personal data, pursuant to Art. 6, Section 1, point f of the GDPR. 
<h3>4.	Duration of storage, opportunity for objection and removal</h3>
Cookies are stored on the computer of the user and transferred by this computer to our website. For this reason, you as the user also have full control over the use of cookies. By making a change to the settings in your Internet browser, you can deactivate or restrict the transfer of cookies. Cookies that are already stored can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are deactivated for our website, it may be the case that not all functions of the website can be used in full.


<h2>V.	E-mail contact</h2>
<h3>1.	Description and scope of data processing</h3>
On our website, contact can be made via the e-mail address provided. In this case, the personal data of the user transferred with the e-mail, including the user’s e-mail address, is stored.<br>

In this context, no data is forwarded to third parties. The data is used solely for the purpose of processing the conversation. 

<h3>2.	Legal basis for data processing </h3>
The legal basis for the processing of data transferred while sending an e-mail is Art. 6, Section 1, point f of the GDPR. If the purpose of the e-mail contact is to conclude a contract, the additional legal basis for the processing is Art. 6, Section 1, point b of the GDPR.

<h3>3.	Purpose of data processing</h3>
We use the processing of personal data solely for the purpose of processing the initial contact. When contact is made via e-mail, this is also the required justified interest in processing the data.<br>

The other personal data processed during the dispatch procedure serves to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.

<h3>4.	Duration of storage</h3>
The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the attainment of the purpose of its collection. For personal data sent via e-mail, this is the case when the respective conversation with the user is terminated. The conversation is terminated when it can be seen from the circumstances that the matter in question has been conclusively clarified.

<h3>5.	Opportunity for objection and removal</h3>
The user has the right to revoke their consent to the processing of personal data at any time. If the user makes e-mail contact with us, they may object to the storage of their personal data at any time via e-mail or by post. In such cases, the conversation will not be continued. All personal data that is stored during the course of making contact will be deleted in such cases.

b)	Exemptions<br>
The right to erasure does not apply to the extent that processing is necessary:<br>
(1)	for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;<br>
(2)	for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;<br>

(5)	for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
<h3>5.	Right to notification</h3>
If you have asserted your right to the rectification, erasure or restriction of processing in relation to the controller, the controller is obliged to communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing carried out to each recipient to whom the personal data has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.<br>

You have the right in relation to the controller to be notified regarding these recipients.
<h3>6.	Right to data portability</h3>
You have the right to receive the personal data relating to you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to transfer this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data has been provided, where<br>
(1)	the processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6, Section 1, point a or Art. 9, Section 2, point a of the GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6, Section 1, point b of the GDPR, and<br>
(2)	the processing is carried out by automated means.<br>
In exercising this right to data portability, you also have the right to have the personal data relating to you transferred directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible. The freedoms and rights of other persons may not be impaired as a result.<br>
The right to data portability does not apply to the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
<h3>7.	Right to object</h3>
You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of personal data relating to you which is based on Art. 6, Section 1, point e or f of the GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions. <br>
The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.<br>
Where personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data relating to you for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. <br>
If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data relating to you shall no longer be processed for such purposes.<br>
You have the opportunity, in connection with the use of services by the information society – Directive 2002/58/EC notwithstanding – to exercise your right to object using automated procedures, in which technical specifications are applied.
<h3>8.	The right to revoke a declaration of consent in relation to data protection</h3>
You have the right to revoke your declaration of consent in relation to data protection at any time. By revoking your consent, the lawfulness of the processing that has occurred before revocation on the basis of your consent remains unaffected.
<h3>9.	Automated decision-making, including profiling</h3>
You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or in a similar way significantly affects you. This does not apply if the decision<br>

(1)	is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the you and the data controller,<br>
(2)	is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or<br>
(3)	is based on your express consent.<br>
However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of personal data pursuant to Art. 9, Section 1 of the GDPR, insofar as Art. 9, Section 2, point a or g of the GDPR applies and suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place.<br>

With regard to the cases named in (1) and (3), the data controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, including at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express your point of view and to contest the decision.

<h3>10.	Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</h3>
Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.<br>

The supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant of the progress and the outcome of the complaint including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Art. 78 of the GDPR.
